# Self-Driving Car: Steering Angle Prediction

-  It Predicts the Steering Wheel Direction Based on the input Images from the Camera
- This project demonstrates a deep learning-based approach to predict the steering wheel angle of a self-driving car based on input images from a front-facing camera. The model is trained on driving data to mimic human driving behavior.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict steering angles from dashboard camera images using a neural network.
- **Input**: Road images captured from a front-facing car camera.
- **Output**: Continuous value representing the steering angle (in degrees/radians).
- **Model**: CNN-based architecture inspired by NVIDIA's End-to-End Self-Driving Car model.
